After extensive investigation, it turned out that the issue was related to a conflict between different versions of a dependency in my project.  Specifically, the `react-native-reanimated` module was conflicting with another dependency that had a different (older) version requirement. Resolving this conflict by carefully managing package versions and dependency trees, specifically through detailed investigation of the `package.json` file and potentially using `npm-check-updates` or `yarn upgrade-interactive`, successfully resolved the problem.  The conflicting package was identified and updated or removed to satisfy the dependency tree.  After this, a fresh install of `node_modules` and restarting `expo start` resolved the issue.
