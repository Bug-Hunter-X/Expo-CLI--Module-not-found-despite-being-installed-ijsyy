While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI.  After running `expo start`, I received an error message indicating that a certain module or package could not be found, even though it was clearly listed in my `package.json` and installed via `npm install` or `yarn add`.  The error message itself was not particularly informative, only stating that the module was missing.  I verified that the module was correctly installed and accessible in my project's node_modules folder but the error persisted.  Cleaning the cache with `expo start --clear` didn't resolve the issue, neither did reinstalling node modules.  The app worked fine when run on an emulator and a physical device.
